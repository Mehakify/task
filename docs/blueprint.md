# **App Name**: TaskZen

## Core Features:

- Google Authentication: Allow the user to create a personal account using their Google Account.
- Anonymous Authentication: Let user sign-in using anonymous credentials (Firebase).
- Task Creation: User should be able to enter title, notes and a desired due date, to generate a Task entry.
- Subtask Management: Add a subtask feature inside each task with the ability to edit and mark as complete. Mark task as completed once all subtasks have been finalized.
- Task Completion: User can mark a task as complete with a simple and straightforward checkbox.
- Task Status: Tasks will have 3 statuses which can be: Pending (default value), Complete and Not Complete. Update from Pending to Not complete will automatically trigger when due date is met.
- Task/Subtask Editing: Tasks can be edited or removed on the main user view. Likewise for subtasks, either while creating the main task, or modifying an existing one.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light blue (#E3F2FD) to convey serenity and focus.
- Background color: White (#FFFFFF) for a clean and open backdrop.
- Accent color: Pale green (#DCEDC8) for subtle highlighting of interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Open Sans', a friendly sans-serif offering a modern and neutral appearance for both headings and body text.
- Use simple, outlined icons from a set like Feather or Material Icons to represent different task categories or actions.
- Employ a clean, card-based layout for tasks to provide clear visual separation.
- Use subtle transitions and animations for task state changes (e.g., when marking a task as complete).
